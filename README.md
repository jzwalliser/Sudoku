# Sudoku
## Introduction
This is a sudoku game written mostly by Deepseek(Only about 30% was written by myself). This game is designed to be played inside CLI, and doesn't need any dependencies. 
## Compiling/Running
The source code is very easy to compile. You can simply throw it into DEV-C++ and compile it, and you can also run it using Cxxdroid.
## Future
If I have time in the future, I will rewrite the whole program by myself without using Deepseek.

And that's all - have fun!
